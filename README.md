The data is used in the context of a student project at UCLouvain for the course Advanced Geoprocessing (LGEO2185).

The work is divided into 2 parts : 
  1. Temporal analysis of changes in the isolation/capita in Wallonia
  2. Which municipalities should receive the most attention for an improvement in isolation/capita in Wallonia ?

For the first part the data needed is : 
  1. 811400_cleaned.xlsx (the PAEE data for each municipality from which isolation is a part)
  2. Population_par_commune.xlsx (Population data per year for each municipality)
  3. shapefile commune/codes-ins-nis-postaux-belgique.shp (The shapefile of Belgian municipalities for the spatial representation of the data)

For the second part the data needed is :
  1. Revenu median 2022 communes.xlsx (The median income per capita for each municipality in 2022)
  2. Proprio_location_2021_commune.xlsx (The part of rented housing for each municipality in 2021)
  3. Parc batiment 2024 communes.xlsx (The number of housing for the different years until 2024)
  4. shapefile commune/codes-ins-nis-postaux-belgique.shp (The shapefile of Belgian municipalities for the spatial representation of the data)
